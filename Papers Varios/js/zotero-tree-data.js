                "This paper updates and builds on \u2018Modelling with Stakeholders\u2019 Voinov and Bousquet, 2010 which demonstrated the importance of, and demand for, stakeholder participation in resource and environmental modelling. This position paper returns to the concepts of that publication and reviews the progress made since 2010. A new development is the wide introduction and acceptance of social media and web applications, which dramatically changes the context and scale of stakeholder interactions and participation. Technology advances make it easier to incorporate information in interactive formats via visualization and games to augment participatory experiences. Citizens as stakeholders are increasingly demanding to be engaged in planning decisions that affect them and their communities, at scales from local to global. How people interact with and access models and data is rapidly evolving. In turn, this requires changes in how models are built, packaged, and disseminated: citizens are less in awe of experts and external authorities, and they are increasingly aware of their own capabilities to provide inputs to planning processes, including models. The continued acceleration of environmental degradation and natural resource depletion accompanies these societal changes, even as there is a growing acceptance of the need to transition to alternative, possibly very different, life styles. Substantive transitions cannot occur without signi\ufb01cant changes in human behaviour and perceptions. The important and diverse roles that models can play in guiding human behaviour, and in disseminating and increasing societal knowledge, are a feature of stakeholder processes today."

                "Various tools and methods are used in participatory modelling, at di\ufb00erent stages of the process and for di\ufb00erent purposes. The diversity of tools and methods can create challenges for stakeholders and modelers when selecting the ones most appropriate for their projects. We o\ufb00er a systematic overview, assessment, and categorization of methods to assist modelers and stakeholders with their choices and decisions. Most available literature provides little justi\ufb01cation or information on the reasons for the use of particular methods or tools in a given study. In most of the cases, it seems that the prior experience and skills of the modelers had a dominant e\ufb00ect on the selection of the methods used. While we have not found any real evidence of this approach being wrong, we do think that putting more thought into the method selection process and choosing the most appropriate method for the project can produce better results. Based on expert opinion and a survey of modelers engaged in participatory processes, we o\ufb00er practical guidelines to improve decisions about method selection at di\ufb00erent stages of the participatory modeling process."

                "Stakeholder engagement, collaboration, or participation, shared learning or fact-\ufb01nding, have become buzz words and hardly any environmental assessment or modelling effort today can be presented without some kind of reference to stakeholders and their involvement in the process. This is clearly a positive development, but in far too many cases stakeholders have merely been paid lip service and their engagement has consequentially been quite nominal. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that better decisions are implemented with less con\ufb02ict and more success when they are driven by stakeholders, that is by those who will be bearing their consequences. Participatory modelling, with its various types and clones, has emerged as a powerful tool that can (a) enhance the stakeholders knowledge and understanding of a system and its dynamics under various conditions, as in collaborative learning, and (b) identify and clarify the impacts of solutions to a given problem, usually related to supporting decision making, policy, regulation or management. In this overview paper we \ufb01rst look at the different types of stakeholder modelling, and compare participatory modelling to other frameworks that involve stakeholder participation. Based on that and on the experience of the projects reported in this issue and elsewhere, we draw some lessons and generalisations. We conclude with an outline of some future directions."

                "Sustainable water resources management relies on understanding how societies and water systems coevolve. Many place-based sociohydrology (SH) modeling studies use proxies, such as environmental degradation, to capture key elements of the social component of system dynamics. Parameters of assumed relationships between environmental degradation and the human response to it are usually obtained through calibration. Since these relationships are not yet underpinned by social-science theories, con\ufb01dence in the predictive power of such place-based sociohydrologic models remains low. The generalizability of SH models therefore requires major advances in incorporating more realistic relationships, underpinned by appropriate hydrological and social-science data and theories. The latter is a critical input, since human culture \u2013 especially values and norms arising from it \u2013 in\ufb02uences behavior and the consequences of behaviors. This paper reviews a key social-science theory that links cultural factors to environmental decision-making, assesses how to better incorporate social-science insights to enhance SH models, and raises important questions to be addressed in moving forward. This is done in the context of recent progress in sociohydrological studies and the gaps that remain to be \ufb01lled. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and opportunities in terms of generalization of SH models and the use of available data to allow future prediction and model transfer to ungauged basins."

                "Socio-hydrology focuses on studying the dynamics and co-evolution of coupled human and water systems. Recently, several new socio-hydrologic models have been published that explore these dynamics, and these models offer unique opportunities to better understand these coupled systems and to understand how water problems evolve similarly in different regions. These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated streamflow, are insufficient, and new techniques must be developed. As socio-hydrology progresses, these models offer a robust, invaluable tool to test hypotheses about the relationships between aspects of coupled human-water systems. They will allow us to explore multiple working hypotheses to greatly expand insights and understanding of coupled socio-hydrologic systems. Key Points: Socio-hydrologic models can be seen as hypotheses of coupled system dynamics Robust validation is required across multiple basins Trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism are required \u00a9 2015.

                "Sociohydrology was launched as the science dealing with feedbacks between coupled human and water systems. Much of the early work in sociohydrology involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected in this Special Section \u201cSociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled Human\u2010Water Systems\u201d illustrate that the scienti\ufb01c scope of sociohydrology has broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems, economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding (i) water metabolism\u2014the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and \ufb02oods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact."

                "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Agenda 2030 represent an ambitious blueprint to reduce inequalities globally and achieve a sustainable future for all mankind. Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society. To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario\u2010based approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural, technical, and social dimensions of human\u2010water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scienti\ufb01c challenges to strengthen the \ufb01eld and broaden its scope. These include engagement with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly in\ufb02uence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time. Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated approach in managing water resources, which involves all actors and stakeholders and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short\u2010term, they often result in unintended consequences in the long\u2010term. Sociohydrology is developing a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical and social processes, which can improve water management practice. As such, advancing sociohydrology can contribute to address the global water crises and meet the water\u2010related targets de\ufb01ned by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals."

                "Over recent decades, the global population has been rapidly increasing and human activities have altered terrestrial water \ufb02uxes to an unprecedented extent. The phenomenal growth of the human footprint has signi\ufb01cantly modi\ufb01ed hydrological processes in various ways (e.g. irrigation, arti\ufb01cial dams, and water diversion) and at various scales (from a watershed to the globe). During the early 1990s, awareness of the potential for increased water scarcity led to the \ufb01rst detailed global water resource assessments. Shortly thereafter, in order to analyse the human perturbation on terrestrial water resources, the \ufb01rst generation of largescale hydrological models (LHMs) was produced. However, at this early stage few models considered the interaction between terrestrial water \ufb02uxes and human activities, including water use and reservoir regulation, and even fewer models distinguished water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Since the early 2000s, a growing number of LHMs have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle, yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging. In this paper we provide a synthesis of progress in the development and application of human impact modelling in LHMs. We highlight a number of key challenges and discuss possible improvements in order to better represent the human\u2013water interface in hydrological models."

                "<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Interactions between humans and the environment are occurring on a scale that has never previously been seen; the scale of human interaction with the water cycle, along with the coupling present between social and hydrological systems, means that decisions that impact water also impact people. Models are often used to assist in decision-making regarding hydrological systems, and so in order for effective decisions to be made regarding water resource management, these interactions and feedbacks should be accounted for in models used to analyse systems in which water and humans interact. This paper reviews literature surrounding aspects of socio-hydrological modelling. It begins with background information regarding the current state of socio-hydrology as a discipline, before covering reasons for modelling and potential applications. Some important concepts that underlie socio-hydrological modelling efforts are then discussed, including ways of viewing socio-hydrological systems, space and time in modelling, complexity, data and model conceptualisation. Several modelling approaches are described, the stages in their development detailed and their applicability to socio-hydrological cases discussed. Gaps in research are then highlighted to guide directions for future research. The review of literature suggests that the nature of socio-hydrological study, being interdisciplinary, focusing on complex interactions between human and natural systems, and dealing with long horizons, is such that modelling will always present a challenge; it is, however, the task of the modeller to use the wide range of tools afforded to them to overcome these challenges as much as possible. The focus in socio-hydrology is on understanding the human\u2013water system in a holistic sense, which differs from the problem solving focus of other water management fields, and as such models in socio-hydrology should be developed with a view to gaining new insight into these dynamics. There is an essential choice that socio-hydrological modellers face in deciding between representing individual system processes or viewing the system from a more abstracted level and modelling it as such; using these different approaches has implications for model development, applicability and the insight that they are capable of giving, and so the decision regarding how to model the system requires thorough consideration of, among other things, the nature of understanding that is sought.</p>"

                "Sociohydrology is the study of coupled human\u2013water systems, building on the premise that water and human systems co-evolve: the state of the water system feeds back onto the human system, and vice versa, a situation denoted as \u201ctwo-way coupling\u201d. A recent special issue in HESS/ESD, \u201cPredictions under change: water, earth, and biota in the Anthropocene\u201d, includes a number of sociohydrologic publications that allow for a survey of the current state of understanding of sociohydrology and the dynamics and feedbacks that couple water and human systems together, of the research methodologies being employed to date, and of the normative and ethical issues raised by the study of sociohydrologic systems. Although sociohydrology is concerned with coupled human\u2013water systems, the feedback may be \ufb01ltered by a connection through natural or social systems, for example, the health of a \ufb01shery or through the global food trade, and therefore it may not always be possible to treat the human\u2013water system in isolation. As part of a larger complex system, sociohydrology can draw on tools developed in the social\u2013ecological and complex systems literature to further our sociohydrologic knowledge, and this is identi\ufb01ed as a ripe area of future research."

                "Environmental degradation is often de\ufb01ned as a public goods problem, emerging when property rights are not clearly de\ufb01ned and costs are externalized to other parties. Proposing corrective regulation that enforces technological \ufb01xes or market-based approaches is often met with political resistance and doubts about its effectiveness. This is partly due to the complexity of interacting physical and socio-economic components that obscure the impacts of human decisionmaking on environmental functions. Yet, understanding the complexity of integrated humanenvironmental systems can help planners and stakeholders frame environmental problems, view their role in them and design effective policies to address them. This article examines the potential and limitations of agent-based models as metaphors that can contribute to the understanding of such complex systems, illustrating the argument with a hypothetical application in groundwater management."

                "We explore how to address the challenges of adaptation of water resources systems under changing conditions by supporting flexible, resilient and low-regret solutions, coupled with on-going monitoring and evaluation. This will require improved understanding of the linkages between biophysical and social aspects in order to better anticipate the possible future co-evolution of water systems and society. We also present a call to enhance the dialogue and foster the actions of governments, the international scientific community, research funding agencies and additional stakeholders in order to develop effective solutions to support water resources systems adaptation. Finally, we call the scientific community to a renewed and unified effort to deliver an innovative message to stakeholders. Water science is essential to resolve the water crisis, but the effectiveness of solutions depends, inter alia, on the capability of scientists to deliver a new, coherent and technical vision for the future development of water systems."

Improvement of water productivity aims at producing more food, income, better livelihoods and ecosystem services with less water. There is considerable scope for improving water productivity of crop, livestock and \ufb01sheries at \ufb01eld through to basin scale. Practices used to achieve this include water harvesting, supplemental irrigation, de\ufb01cit irrigation, precision irrigation techniques and soil\u2013water conservation practices. Practices not directly related to water management impact water productivity because of interactive effects such as those derived from improvements in soil fertility, pest and disease control, crop selection or access to better markets."

                    "During the second half of the 20th century the global food production more than doubled and thus responded to the doubling of world population. But the gains in food production came at a cost, leaving a signi\ufb01cant environmental footprint on the ecosystem. Global cropland, plantations and pastures expanded, with large increases in fossil energy, water, and fertilizer inputs, imprinting considerable footprint on the environment. Information from pre eminent publications such as Nature, Science, PNAS and scholarly journals is synthesized to assess the water and energy footprints of global food production. The data show that the footprints are signi\ufb01cant, both locally, national and globally and have consequences for global food security and ecosystem health and productivity. The literature nearly agrees that global food production system generates considerable environmental footprints and the situation would likely get worrisome, as global population grows by 50% by 2050. Investments are needed today to buffer the negative impacts of food production on the environment. Investments to boost water productivity and improve energy use ef\ufb01ciency in crop production are two pathways to reduce the environmental footprint."

                    "Fresh water is a renewable resource, but it is also \ufb01nite. Around the world, there are now numerous signs that human water use exceeds sustainable levels. Groundwater depletion, low or nonexistent river \ufb02ows, and worsening pollution levels are among the more obvious indicators of water stress. In many areas, extracting more water for human uses jeopardizes the health of vital aquatic ecosystems. Satisfying the increased demands for food, water, and material goods of a growing global population while at the same time protecting the ecological services provided by natural water ecosystems requires new approaches to using and managing fresh water. In this article, I propose a global effort (1) to ensure that freshwater ecosystems receive the quantity, quality, and timing of \ufb02ows needed for them to perform their ecological functions and (2) to work toward a goal of doubling water productivity. Meeting these challenges will require policies that promote rather than discourage water ef\ufb01ciency, as well as new partnerships that cross disciplinary and professional boundaries."

                    "It is surprisingly dif\ufb01cult to determine whether water is truly scarce in the physical sense at a global scale (a supply problem) or whether it is available but should be used better (a demand problem). The paper reviews water scarcity indicators and global assessments based on these indicators. The most widely used indicator, the Falkenmark indicator, is popular because it is easy to apply and understand but it does not help to explain the true nature of water scarcity. The more complex indicators are not widely applied because data are lacking to apply them and the de\ufb01nitions are not intuitive. Water is de\ufb01nitely physically scarce in densely populated arid areas, Central and West Asia, and North Africa, with projected availabilities of less than 1000 m3/capita/ year. This scarcity relates to water for food production, however, and not to water for domestic purposes that are minute at this scale. In most of the rest of the world water scarcity at a national scale has as much to do with the development of the demand as the availability of the supply. Accounting for water for environmental requirements shows that abstraction of water for domestic, food and industrial uses already have a major impact on ecosystems in many parts of the world, even those not considered \u2018\u2018water scarce\u2019\u2019. Water will be a major constraint for agriculture in coming decades and particularly in Asia and Africa this will require major institutional adjustments. A \u2018\u2018soft path\u2019\u2019 to address water scarcity, focusing on increasing overall water productivity, is recommended."

                    "The great challenge of the agricultural sector is to produce more food from less water, which can be achieved by increasing Crop Water Productivity (CWP). Based on a review of 84 literature sources with results of experiments not older than 25 years, it was found that the ranges of CWP of wheat, rice, cotton and maize exceed in all cases those reported by FAO earlier. Globally measured average CWP values per unit water depletion are 1.09, 1.09, 0.65, 0.23 and 1.80 kg m\u22123 for wheat, rice, cottonseed, cottonlint and maize, respectively. The range of CWP is very large (wheat, 0.6\u20131.7 kg m\u22123; rice, 0.6\u20131.6 kg m\u22123; cottonseed, 0.41\u20130.95 kg m\u22123; cottonlint, 0.14\u20130.33 kg m\u22123 and maize, 1.1\u20132.7 kg m\u22123) and thus offers tremendous opportunities for maintaining or increasing agricultural production with 20\u201340% less water resources. The variability of CWP can be ascribed to: (i) climate; (ii) irrigation water management and (iii) soil (nutrient) management, among others. The vapour pressure de\ufb01cit is inversely related to CWP. Vapour pressure de\ufb01cit decreases with latitude, and thus favourable areas for water wise irrigated agriculture are located at the higher latitudes. The most outstanding conclusion is that CWP can be increased signi\ufb01cantly if irrigation is reduced and crop water de\ufb01cit is intendently induced."

                "Expectations are that the agricultural sector will have to expand the use of water for irrigation to meet rising food demand, while at the same time the competition for water resources is growing in many regions. Increasing water productivity in agriculture is widely seen as a critical response to help address this challenge. Yet much of the public debate is vague on the meaning of agricultural water productivity \u2014 often emphasizing \u201cmore crop per drop\u201d as if water were the only input that mattered \u2014, and approaches for assessing and increasing water productivity are seldom addressed systematically. This paper discusses conceptual issues that should be kept in mind when assessing agricultural water productivity, and presents findings from what may be the first survey of the agricultural productivity and efficiency literature with regard to the explicit inclusion of water aspects in productivity and efficiency measurements. The survey comprises studies applying single-factor productivity (SFP) measures, total factor productivity (TFP) indices and frontier models. Studies using deductive methods are also included. A key finding is that the studies tend to either incorporate field- and basin-level aspects but focus only on a single input (water), or they apply multi-factor approaches but do not tackle the basin-level aspects. It seems that no study has yet presented an approach that accounts for multiple inputs and basin-level issues. Deductive methods may provide the flexibility to overcome some of the limitations of the other methods."

                "Water use concepts and performance descriptors that may be useful in de\ufb01ning conservation and saving of water are discussed with the aim of improving the overall performance and productivity of water use. New indicators are proposed which include consideration of water reuse and aim to assist in identifying and providing clear distinctions between bene\ufb01cial and non-bene\ufb01cial water uses. An analysis of productivity concepts useful both in irrigation and elsewhere is provided together with suggestions for where commonly used terms, such as the broadly used \u201cwater use ef\ufb01ciency\u201d among others, would be better avoided in irrigation engineering and given much more narrowly de\ufb01ned meanings in agronomy and biological sciences. Particular attention is given to economic issues in water productivity. The analysis is completed with various case study applications at irrigation farm and system scales. It is recommended that a set of terms (not necessarily those developed here) be widely adopted that will provide a basis for easy, certain communication and provide widespread common understanding of the issues which must be faced to develop approaches to achieve ef\ufb01cient water use."

                "Recent developments of global models and data sets enable a new, spatially explicit and process-based assessment of green and blue water in food production and trade. An initial intercomparison of a range of different (hydrological, vegetation, crop, water resources and economic) models, con\ufb01rms that green water use in global crop production is about 4\u20135 times greater than consumptive blue water use. Hence, the full green-to-blue spectrum of agricultural water management options needs to be used when tackling the increasing water gap in food production. The different models calculate considerable potentials for complementing the conventional approach of adding irrigation, with measures to increase water productivity, such as rainwater harvesting, supplementary irrigation, vapour shift and soil and nutrient management. Several models highlight Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, as a key region for improving water productivity in agriculture, by implementing these measures."

                "Irrigation is an important measure for increasing grain production. Improving water use ef\ufb01ciency in agriculture is expected to play a very important role in ensuring food and water security in China, since there is a serious problem between food supply and limited water resources in China. The present state and future trend of water and food security in China were analyzed, while the importance of irrigation in ensuring China food security was highlighted based on the analysis of the evolution of irrigation water productivity in recent 60 years and its relationships with changes of crop yield, cropping pattern, fertilization and irrigation water use. Research progresses and practical application on high-ef\ufb01cient agricultural water use in China were introduced, and two successful cases of improving agricultural water productivity in China were presented, one was to improve crop water use ef\ufb01ciency by the novel irrigation method based on crop physiological responses, and the other was to improve the regional water productivity by the integrative methods in the Shiyang River Basin of Northwest China. The major research areas needed to focus on in the future were discussed, which include responses of crop water demand to changing environment and associated spatio-temporal optimization of water allocation, multi-processes hydrologic cycle of irrigated land under strong in\ufb02uences of human activities, integrated measures for improving multi-scale agricultural water use ef\ufb01ciency, and interactions between grain production, water resources and ecological system and its sustainability analysis in a systematic way."

                "Growing water scarcity and increasing demands for agricultural products generate much debate about improving the agricultural sector\u2019s water use ef\ufb01ciency and productivity. Agricultural engineering traditions feed this debate with notions such as agricultural yield gaps and low water use ef\ufb01ciencies that draw attention to potential improvements. However, when perspectives are shifted from an irrigated \ufb01eld to a river basin, someone\u2019s (water) loss may be another\u2019s (water) gain. Such shifts in perspectives complicate the applications of our concepts of irrigation ef\ufb01ciency (IE), water use ef\ufb01ciency (WUE) and water productivity (WP). This paper studies the use and abuse of de\ufb01nitions and applications of concepts of IE, WUE and WP and examines their appropriate application for different scales and domains of water use. In this paper we argue that water management decisions are best informed by using IE and WP at the irrigation scheme and catchment level, respectively. This use can identify context speci\ufb01c opportunities and potentials for increased water use ef\ufb01ciency and productivity as well as the potential trade-offs in water re-allocations between diverse water users and uses."

                "This paper re-visits the concept of water ef\ufb01ciency applied to Spanish agriculture and assesses how this technical concept is sometimes lost in translation when applied at different spatial scales. The paper traces the historical dominance of irrigated agriculture in Spanish water policy. It analyses the water ef\ufb01ciency concept at the macro level, by evaluating recent national policy initiatives and public investment programmes over the last decade to modernise irrigation, which anticipated large water savings. \u201cWater ef\ufb01ciency\u201d is then framed in its socio-political context, by looking at debates and discussions over the past, current and future role of irrigation, key evaluation criteria and objectives for large scale irrigation modernisation plans, what are the links to water rights and allocation, bene\ufb01ts and bene\ufb01ciaries from water savings and important unanticipated consequences and co-bene\ufb01ts in modernisation, and the reform of agricultural policies. Finally it identi\ufb01es the central role played at national, European and global levels by agricultural (and energy) policies as key external drivers for the long term viability of modern irrigation on social, environmental and economic-productivity terms."

                "The authors of the recently completed Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture (CA) concluded that there are suf\ufb01cient water resources to produce food for a growing population but that trends in consumption, production and environmental patterns, if continued, will lead to water crises in many parts of the world. Only if we act to improve water use will we meet the acute fresh water challenge. Recent spikes in food prices, partially caused by the increasing demand for agricultural products in non-food uses, underline the urgent need to invest in agricultural production, of which water management is a crucial part. The world experienced similar pressure on per capita food supplies and food prices in the 1960s and 1970s, but the challenges now are different than those we experienced 50 years ago. The world\u2019s population is substantially larger, there are many more people living in poverty, and the costs of many agricultural inputs are much higher. The current situation and the long-term outlook require a fresh look at approaches that combine different elements such as the importance of access to water for the poor, providing multiple ecosystem services, rainwater management, adapting irrigation to new needs, enhancing water productivity, and promoting the use of low-quality water in agriculture. This special issue highlights the analysis behind a number of policy options identi\ufb01ed by the CA, a \ufb01ve-year multi-disciplinary research program involving 700 scientists. This introductory article sets the background and context of this special issue, introduces the key recommendations from the CA and summarizes the papers in this issue."

                "In the coming few decades, global freshwater demand will increase to meet the growing demand for food, \ufb01bre and biofuel crops. Raising water productivity in agriculture, that is reducing the water footprint (WF) per unit of production, will contribute to reducing the pressure on the limited global freshwater resources. This study establishes a set of global WF benchmark values for a large number of crops grown in the world. The study distinguishes between benchmarks for the green\u2013blue WF (the sum of rain- and irrigation water consumption) and the grey WF (volume of polluted water). The reference period is 1996\u20132005. We analysed the spatial distribution of the green\u2013blue and grey WFs of different crops as calculated at a spatial resolution of 5 by 50 with a dynamic water balance and crop yield model. Per crop, we ranked the WF values for all relevant grid cells from smallest to largest and plotted these values against the cumulative percentage of the corresponding production. The study shows that if we would reduce the green\u2013blue WF of crop production everywhere in the world to the level of the best 25th percentile of current global production, global water saving in crop production would be 39% compared to the reference water consumption. With a reduction to the WF levels of the best 10th percentile of current global production, the water saving would be 52%. In the case that nitrogen-related grey WFs in crop production are reduced, worldwide, to the level of the best 25th percentile of current global production, water pollution is reduced by 54%. If grey WFs per ton of crop are further reduced to the level of the best 10th percentile of current production, water pollution is reduced by 79%. The benchmark values provide valuable information for formulating WF reduction targets in crop production. Further studies will be required to test the sensitivity of the benchmark values to the underlying model assumptions, to see whether regionalization of benchmarks is necessary and how certain WF benchmark levels relate to speci\ufb01c technology and agricultural practices."

                "Population increase and the improvement of living standards brought about by development will result in a sharp increase in food demand during the next decades. Most of this increase will be met by the products of irrigated agriculture. At the same time, the water input per unit irrigated area will have to be reduced in response to water scarcity and environmental concerns. Water productivity is projected to increase through gains in crop yield and reductions in irrigation water. In order to meet these projections, irrigation systems will have to be modernized and optimised. Water productivity can be de\ufb01ned in a number of ways, although it always represents the output of a given activity (in economic terms, if possible) divided by some expression of water input. Five expressions for this indicator were identi\ufb01ed, using different approaches to water input. A hydrological analysis of water productivity poses a number of questions on the choice of the water input expression. In fact, when adopting a basin-wide perspective, irrigation return \ufb02ows often can not be considered as net water losses. A number of irrigation modernization and optimization measures are discussed in the paper. Particular attention was paid to the improvement of irrigation management, which shows much better economic return than the improvement of the irrigation structures. The hydrological effects of these improvements may be deceiving, since they will be accompanied by larger crop evapotranspiration and even increased cropping intensity. As a consequence, less water will be available for alternative uses."

                "Rainfed agriculture plays and will continue to play a dominant role in providing food and livelihoods for an increasing world population. We describe the world\u2019s semi-arid and dry sub-humid savannah and steppe regions as global hotspots, in terms of water related constraints to food production, high prevalence of malnourishment and poverty, and rapidly increasing food demands. We argue that major water investments in agriculture are required. In these regions yield gaps are large, not due to lack of water per se, but rather due to inef\ufb01cient management of water, soils, and crops. An assessment of management options indicates that knowledge exists regarding technologies, management systems, and planning methods. A key strategy is to minimise risk for dry spell induced crop failures, which requires an emphasis on water harvesting systems for supplemental irrigation. Large-scale adoption of water harvesting systems will require a paradigm shift in Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), in which rainfall is regarded as the entry point for the governance of freshwater, thus incorporating green water resources (sustaining rainfed agriculture and terrestrial ecosystems) and blue water resources (local runoff). The divide between rainfed and irrigated agriculture needs to be reconsidered in favor of a governance, investment, and management paradigm, which considers all water options in agricultural systems. A new focus is needed on the meso-catchment scale, as opposed to the current focus of IWRM on the basin level and the primary focus of agricultural improvements on the farmer\u2019s \ufb01eld. We argue that the catchment scale offers the best opportunities for water investments to build resilience in smallscale agricultural systems and to address trade-offs between water for food and other ecosystem functions and services."

                "Managing water resources in a complex adaptive natural\u2013human system is a challenge due to the dif\ufb01culty of modeling human behavior under uncertain risk perception. The interaction between human-engineered systems and natural processes needs to be modeled explicitly with an approach that can quantify the in\ufb02uence of incomplete/ambiguous information on decision-making processes. In this study, we two-way coupled an agent-based model (ABM) with a river-routing and reservoir management model (RiverWare) to address this challenge. The human decisionmaking processes is described in the ABM using Bayesian inference (BI) mapping joined with a cost\u2013loss (CL) model (BC-ABM). Incorporating BI mapping into an ABM allows an agent\u2019s psychological thinking process to be speci\ufb01ed by a cognitive map between decisions and relevant preceding factors that could affect decision-making. A risk perception parameter is used in the BI mapping to represent an agent\u2019s belief on the preceding factors. Integration of the CL model addresses an agent\u2019s behavior caused by changing socioeconomic conditions. We use the San Juan River basin in New Mexico, USA, to demonstrate the utility of this method. The calibrated BC-ABM\u2013RiverWare model is shown to capture the dynamics of historical irrigated area and stream\ufb02ow changes. The results suggest that the proposed BC-ABM framework provides an improved representation of human decision-making processes compared to conventional rulebased ABMs that do not take risk perception into account. Future studies will focus on modifying the BI mapping to consider direct agents\u2019 interactions, up-front cost of agent\u2019s decision, and upscaling the watershed ABM to the regional scale."

                "In the event of contamination of a water distribution system, decisions must be made to mitigate the impact of the contamination and to protect public health. Making threat management decisions while a contaminant spreads through the network is a dynamic and interactive process. Response actions taken by the utility managers and water consumption choices made by the consumers will affect the hydraulics, and thus the spread of the contaminant plume, in the network. A modeling framework that allows the simulation of a contamination event under the effects of actions taken by utility managers and consumers will be a useful tool for the analysis of alternative threat mitigation and management strategies. This article presents a multiagent modeling framework that combines agent-based, mechanistic, and dynamic methods. Agents select actions based on a set of rules that represent an individual's autonomy, goal-based desires, and reaction to the environment and the actions of other agents. Consumer behaviors including ingestion, mobility, reduction of water demands, and word-of-mouth communication are simulated. Management strategies are evaluated, including opening hydrants to flush the contaminant and broadcasts. As actions taken by consumer agents and utility operators affect demands and flows in the system, the mechanistic model is updated. Management strategies are evaluated based on the exposure of the population to the contaminant. The framework is designed to consider the typical issues involved in water distribution threat management and provides valuable analysis of threat containment strategies for water distribution system contamination events. \u00a9 2011 Society for Risk Analysis."

                "A watershed can be simulated as a multiagent system (MAS) composed of spatially distributed land and water users (agents) within a common defined environment. The watershed system is characterized by distributed decision processes at the agent level with a coordination mechanism organizing the interactions among individual decision processes at the system level. This paper presents a decentralized (distributed) optimization method known as constraint-based reasoning, which allows individual agents in an MAS to optimize their behaviors over various alternatives. The method incorporates the optimization of all agents' objectives through an interaction scheme, in which the ith agent optimizes its objective with a selected priority for collaboration and forwards the solution and consequences to all agents that interact with it. Agents are allowed to determine how important their own objectives are in comparison with the constraints, using a local interest factor (\u03b2i). A large \u03b2i value indicates a selfish agent who puts high priority on its own benefit and ignores collaboration requirements. This bottom-up problem-solving approach mimics real-world watershed management problems better than conventional \"top-down\" optimization methods in which it is assumed that individual agents will completely comply with any recommendations that the coordinator makes. The method is applied to a steady state hypothetical watershed with three off-stream human agents, one in-stream human agent (reservoir), and two ecological agents.

                "Many large-scale water resources systems, especially in transboundary contexts, are characterized by the presence of several and conflicting interests and managed by multiple, institutionally independent decision makers. These systems are often studied adopting a centralized approach based on the assumption of full cooperation and information exchange among the involved parties. Such a perspective is conceptually interesting to quantify the best achievable performance but might have little practical impact given the real political and institutional setting. In this work, we propose a novel decision-analytic framework based on multiagent systems to model and analyze different levels of cooperation and information exchange among multiple decision makers. The Zambezi River basin is used as a case study. According to the proposed agent-based optimization approach, each agent represents a decision maker, whose decisions are defined by an explicit optimization problem considering only the agent's local interests. The economic value of information exchange is estimated comparing a noncooperative setting, where agents act independently, with the first basic level of cooperation, i.e., coordination, characterized by full information exchange. The economic value of cooperation is also estimated by comparison with the ideal, fully cooperative management of the system. Results show that coordination, obtained with complete information exchange, allows the downstream agents to better adapt to the upstream behaviors. The impact of information exchange depends on the objective considered, and we show coordination to be particularly beneficial to environmental interests. \u00a9 2013. American Geophysical Union.

                "Many water resources systems include multiple, independent, and distributed decision makers representing different and conflicting interests. In much of the water resources literature, the operation of these systems is studied assuming a fully cooperative attitude by the parties involved and maximizing the global efficiency at the system-level. However, assuming the presence of a social planner might be questionable when multiple institutions are involved, particularly in transboundary systems. At the other extreme, totally uncoordinated strategies among institutionally independent decision makers, acting according to the principle of individual-rationality, are more often experienced in these contexts, yielding a decrease in the system-level performance. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed based on multiagent systems to support the design of regulatory mechanisms, which drive the originally fully independent decision makers towards a more coordinated and system-wide efficient situation. The agent-based model is coupled with tools and algorithms based on distributed constraint reasoning to represent the interactions between the decision makers. The approach is demonstrated on a hypothetical water allocation problem, involving several active human agents and passive ecological agents. Different regulatory mechanisms are explored in three different scenarios of water availability to quantitatively support the discussion about the efficiency-acceptability trade-off. Numerical results show that the proposed approach has a great potential to support the design of distributed solutions balancing system-level efficiency and individual-level acceptability. \u00a9 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers."

                "The freshwater environment is facing unprecedented global pressures. Unsustainable use of surface and groundwater is ubiquitous. Gross pollution is seen in developing economies, nutrient pollution is a global threat to aquatic ecosystems, and \ufb02ood damage is increasing. Droughts have severe local consequences, but effects on food can be global. These current pressures are set in the context of rapid environmental change and socio-economic development, population growth, and weak and fragmented governance. We ask what should be the role of the water science community in addressing water security challenges. Deeper understanding of aquatic and terrestrial environments and their interactions with the climate system is needed, along with trans-disciplinary analysis of vulnerabilities to environmental and societal change. The human dimension must be fully integrated into water science research and viewed as an endogenous component of water system dynamics. Land and water management are inextricably linked, and thus more cross-sector coordination of research and policy is imperative. To solve real-world problems, the products of science must emerge from an iterative, collaborative, two-way exchange with management and policy communities. Science must produce knowledge that is deemed to be credible, legitimate, and salient by relevant stakeholders, and the social process of linking science to policy is thus vital to efforts to solve water problems. The paper shows how a large-scale catchment-based observatory can be used to practice trans-disciplinary science integration and address the Anthropocene\u2019s water problems."

                "We explore how to address the challenges of adaptation of water resources systems under changing conditions by supporting flexible, resilient and low-regret solutions, coupled with on-going monitoring and evaluation. This will require improved understanding of the linkages between biophysical and social aspects in order to better anticipate the possible future co-evolution of water systems and society. We also present a call to enhance the dialogue and foster the actions of governments, the international scientific community, research funding agencies and additional stakeholders in order to develop effective solutions to support water resources systems adaptation. Finally, we call the scientific community to a renewed and unified effort to deliver an innovative message to stakeholders. Water science is essential to resolve the water crisis, but the effectiveness of solutions depends, inter alia, on the capability of scientists to deliver a new, coherent and technical vision for the future development of water systems."

                "Over recent decades, the global population has been rapidly increasing and human activities have altered terrestrial water \ufb02uxes to an unprecedented extent. The phenomenal growth of the human footprint has signi\ufb01cantly modi\ufb01ed hydrological processes in various ways (e.g. irrigation, arti\ufb01cial dams, and water diversion) and at various scales (from a watershed to the globe). During the early 1990s, awareness of the potential for increased water scarcity led to the \ufb01rst detailed global water resource assessments. Shortly thereafter, in order to analyse the human perturbation on terrestrial water resources, the \ufb01rst generation of largescale hydrological models (LHMs) was produced. However, at this early stage few models considered the interaction between terrestrial water \ufb02uxes and human activities, including water use and reservoir regulation, and even fewer models distinguished water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Since the early 2000s, a growing number of LHMs have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle, yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging. In this paper we provide a synthesis of progress in the development and application of human impact modelling in LHMs. We highlight a number of key challenges and discuss possible improvements in order to better represent the human\u2013water interface in hydrological models."

                "This paper provides an introduction to the concepts of water security including not only the risks to human wellbeing posed by floods and droughts, but also the threats of inadequate supply of water in both quantity and quality for food production, human health, energy and industrial production, and for the natural ecosystems on which life depends. The overall setting is one of constant change in all aspects of Earth systems. Hydrological systems (processes and regimes) are changing, resulting from varying and changing precipitation and energy inputs, changes in surface covers, mining of groundwater resources, and storage and diversions by dams and infrastructures. Changes in social, political and economic conditions include population and demographic shifts, political realignments, changes in financial systems and in trade patterns. There is an urgent need to address hydrological and social changes simultaneously and in combination rather than as separate entities, and thus the need to develop the approach of \u2018socio-hydrology\u2019. All aspects of water security, including the responses of both UNESCO and the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) to the concepts of socio-hydrology, are examined in detailed papers within the volume titled Hydrological Sciences and Water Security: Past, Present and Future."

                "The trouble with groundwater is that despite its critical importance to global water supplies, it frequently attracts insuf\ufb01cient management attention relative to more visible surface water sources, irrespective of regional climate, socioeconomic pro\ufb01le, and regulatory environment. To this end, the recently de\ufb01ned sub-discipline of \u201csocio-hydrogeology\u201d, an extension of socio-hydrology, seeks to translate and exchange knowledge with and between non-expert end-users, in addition to involving non-expert opinion and experience in hydrogeological investigations, thus emphasising a \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology. It is widely acknowledged that issues pertaining to groundwater quality, groundwater quantity, climate change, and a poor general awareness and understanding of groundwater occurrence and movement are global in their scope. Moreover, while effective communication and engagement represent the key tenet of socio-hydrogeology, the authors consider that multiple actors should be identi\ufb01ed and incorporated using stakeholder network analysis and may include policymakers, media and communications experts, mobile technology developers, and social scientists, to appropriately convey demographically focused bi-directional information, with the hydrogeological community representing the communication keystone. Accordingly, this article aims to highlight past and current work, elucidate key areas of development within socio-hydrogeology, and offer recommendations to ensure global ef\ufb01cacy of this increasingly important and growing \ufb01eld going forward. The authors seek to assist in protecting our global groundwater resource for future generations via an improved framework for understanding the interaction between communities and hydrogeological systems."

                "Socio-hydrology advanced the \ufb01eld of hydrology by considering humans and their activities as part of the water cycle, rather than as external drivers. Models are used to infer reproducible trends in human interactions with water resources. However, de\ufb01ning and handling water problems in this way may restrict the scope of such modeling approaches. We propose an interdisciplinary socio-hydrological approach to overcome this limit and complement modeling approaches. It starts from concrete \ufb01eld-based situations, combines disciplinary as well as local knowledge on water-society relationships, with the aim of broadening the hydrocentric analysis and modeling of water systems. The paper argues that an analysis of social dynamics linked to water is highly complementary to traditional hydrological tools but requires a negotiated and contextualized interdisciplinary approach to the representation and analysis of socio-hydro systems. This re\ufb02ection emerged from experience gained in the \ufb01eld where a water-budget modeling framework failed to adequately incorporate the multiplicity of (nonhydrological) factors that determine the volumes of withdrawals for irrigation. The pathway subsequently explored was to move away from the hydrologic view of the phenomena and, in collaboration with social scientists, to produce a shared conceptualization of a coupled human-water system through a negotiated approach. This approach changed the way hydrological research issues were addressed and limited the number of strong assumptions needed for simpli\ufb01cation in modeling. The proposed socio-hydrological approach led to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind local water-related problems and to debates on the interactions between social and political decisions and the dynamics of these problems."

                "Watershed system models are urgently needed to understand complex watershed systems and to support integrated river basin management. Early watershed modeling efforts focused on the representation of hydrologic processes, while the next-generation watershed models should represent the coevolution of the water-land-air-plant-human nexus in a watershed and provide capability of decision-making support. We propose a new modeling framework and discuss the know-how approach to incorporate emerging knowledge into integrated models through data exchange interfaces. We argue that the modeling environment is a useful tool to enable effective model integration, as well as create domain-speci\ufb01c models of river basin systems. The grand challenges in developing next-generation watershed system models include but are not limited to providing an overarching framework for linking natural and social sciences, building a scienti\ufb01cally based decision support system, quantifying and controlling uncertainties, and taking advantage of new technologies and new \ufb01ndings in the various disciplines of watershed science. The eventual goal is to build transdisciplinary, scienti\ufb01cally sound, and scale-explicit watershed system models that are to be codesigned by multidisciplinary communities."

                "We present a coevolutionary view of hydrologic systems, revolving around feedbacks between environmental and social processes operating across different time scales. This brings to the fore an emphasis on emergent phenomena in changing water systems, such as the levee effect, adaptation to change, system lock-in, and system collapse due to resource depletion. Changing human values play a key role in the emergence of these phenomena and should therefore be considered as internal to the system. Guidance is provided for the framing and modeling of these phenomena to test alternative hypotheses about how they arose. A plurality of coevolutionary models, from stylized to comprehensive system-of-system models, may assist strategic water management for long time scales through facilitating stakeholder participation, exploring the possibility space of alternative futures, and helping to synthesize the observed dynamics in a wide range of case studies. Future research opportunities lie in exploring emergent phenomena arising from time scale interactions through historical, comparative, and process studies of human-water feedbacks."

                "In many parts of the world the combined pressures of population growth and a drying climate have resulted in the proliferation of water focused policies which aim to increase the resilience of socio-ecological systems. Until recently, these policies often re\ufb02ected surface water centric views of water resources, with groundwater receiving scant attention. In this paper we provide an introduction to the importance of groundwater for waterdependent socio-ecological systems and why it needs to be better incorporated into environmental water management policies. Speci\ufb01cally we highlight the key role of groundwater in buffering the environment and socio-economic activities against drought. We also outline some of the key challenges that face policymakers and managers implementing groundwater management policies. These include dealing with groundwater resources that are spatially and temporally mismatched with surface water resources; transboundary governance issues; challenges between focusing on either preventative or restorative actions and most importantly limited knowledge about groundwater resources and groundwater\u2013ecology relationships. We hope that the information in this paper will assist in the development of sustainable surfacegroundwater water management policies, as well as highlight important challenges that should be considered before implementing groundwater related policies."

            "With rivers in critical regions already exploited to capacity throughout the world and groundwater overdraft as well as large-scale contamination occurring in many areas, we have entered an era in which multiple simultaneous stresses will drive water management. Increasingly, groundwater resources are taking a more prominent role in providing freshwater supplies. We discuss the competing fresh groundwater needs for human consumption, food production, energy, and the environment, as well as physical hazards, and con\ufb02icts due to transboundary overexploitation. During the past 50 years, groundwater management modeling has focused on combining simulation with optimization methods to inspect important problems ranging from contaminant remediation to agricultural irrigation management. The compound challenges now faced by water planners require a new generation of aquifer management models that address the broad impacts of global change on aquifer storage and depletion trajectory management, land subsidence, groundwater-dependent ecosystems, seawater intrusion, anthropogenic and geogenic contamination, supply vulnerability, and long-term sustainability. The scope of research efforts is only beginning to address complex interactions using multiagent system models that are not readily formulated as optimization problems and that consider a suite of human behavioral responses."

            "Socio-hydrology focuses on studying the dynamics and co-evolution of coupled human and water systems. Recently, several new socio-hydrologic models have been published that explore these dynamics, and these models offer unique opportunities to better understand these coupled systems and to understand how water problems evolve similarly in different regions. These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated stream\ufb02ow, are insuf\ufb01cient, and new techniques must be developed. As socio-hydrology progresses, these models offer a robust, invaluable tool to test hypotheses about the relationships between aspects of coupled human-water systems. They will allow us to explore multiple working hypotheses to greatly expand insights and understanding of coupled socio-hydrologic systems."

            "The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is confronted with a severe freshwater crisis shaped by excess water demand and intermittent public supply. In Jordan\u2019s capital and most populous city, Amman, the pervasive water shortage gave rise to private tanker water operations, which transport groundwater from wells in the vicinity of the city and sell it to urban consumers. These tanker water markets have received little attention in the literature up to date, particularly with regard to their relevance for commercial water users. This paper aims to empirically estimate the water demand of commercial establishments in Amman under public supply rationing and to assess to which extent tanker operations contribute to meeting commercial water needs. Building on a prior simulation model of residential water consumption, the results of three extensive surveys concerned with tanker water markets and various geographic data, we develop a spatial agent-based model of the water consumption behavior of commercial establishments in different sizes. According to our estimation, 35\u201345% of the overall water volume consumed by the commercial sector stems from tanker operations, depending on the season. We find that the local disparities in access to affordable network water, along with the dispersion of groundwater wells around the city, result in considerable spatial differences in tanker water consumption. The outcome of this analysis could be relevant for policy attempting to enhance freshwater sustainability in Jordan."

            "The environmental planning literature proposes a set of \"best management practices\" for urban development that assumes improvement in environmental quality as a result of specific urban patterns. Recent work questions this assumption, showing the need to qualify such statements with considerations of physical and ecological context, temporal and spatial scale, and interactions and processes. We explore the benefits and drawbacks of different degrees of model coupling to examine this complexity, and use the integration of an agent-based model of land-use change and a groundwater flow numerical model as an illustration. Model integration allowed us to examine the multi-dimensional effects of land-use patterns and extract useful policy implications. Nevertheless, uncoupled models provide useful approximations to integration, as well as a reference to evaluate the outputs of other forms of modeling."

            "The research project GLOWA-Danube, \ufb01nanced by the German Federal Government, is investigating long-term changes in the water cycle of the upper Danube river basin (77,000 km2) in light of global climatic change. Its aim is to build a fully integrated decision-support tool \u2018\u2018DANUBIA\u2019\u2019 that combines the competence of 11 di\ufb00erent research institutes in domains covering all major aspects governing the water cycle\u2014from the formation of clouds, to groundwater \ufb02ow patterns, to the behaviour of the water consumer. Both the in\ufb02uence of natural changes in the ecosystem, such as climate change, and changes in human behaviour, such as changes in land use or water consumption, are considered. DANUBIA is comprised of 15 individual disciplinary models that are connected via customized interfaces that facilitate network-based parallel calculations. The strictly object-oriented DANUBIA architecture was developed using the graphical notation tool UML (Uni\ufb01ed Modeling Language) and has been implemented in Java code. All models use the same spatial discretisation for the exchange of data (1 \u00b7 1 km grid cells) but are using di\ufb00erent time steps. The representation of a vast number of relevant physical and social processes that occur at di\ufb00erent spatial and temporal scales is a very demanding task. Newly developed up- and downscaling procedures [Rojanschi, V., 2001. E\ufb00ects of upscaling for a \ufb01nite-difference \ufb02ow model. Master\u00d5s Thesis, Institut fu\u00a8 r Wasserbau, Universita\u00a8t Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany] and a sophisticated time controller developed by the computer sciences group [Hennicker, R., Barth, M., Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2002.

In: GSF (Ed.), GLOWA, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle Status Report 2002. GSF, Munich, pp. 35\u201338; Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2003. GLOWA-Danube Papers Technical Release No. 002 (Danubia Framework), Software-Release No.: 0.9.2, Documentation Version: 0.10, Release Date: 27 March 2003] are required to solve the emerging problems. After a \ufb01rst successful public demonstration of the DANUBIA package (nine models) in May 2002 [Mauser, W., Stolz, R., Colgan, A., 2002. GLOWA-Danube: integrative techniques, scenarios and strategies regarding global change of the water cycle. In: GSF (Ed.), GLOWA, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle (Phase I, 2000\u20132003) Status Report 2002. GSF, Munich, pp. 31\u201334], the research consortium is now preparing a \ufb01rst validation run of DANUBIA for the period 1995\u20131999 with all 15 models. After successful completion of the validation, a scenario run based on IPCC climate scenarios [IPCC, 2001. Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report. In: Watson, R.T., Core Writing Team (Eds.), A Contribution of Working Groups I, II, and III to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA, 398pp] for a \ufb01ve year period between 2025 and 2040 will follow at the end of 2003."

            "Provision of water services is a critical strategy for addressing worldwide poverty, and this is one of the most pressing challenges of current times and is linked to population growth and climate change. Progress has been slow in achieving even the Millennium Development Goals aimed at improving coverage of adequate water services and professionals are struggling to cope with the diversity and scale of situations. Water services provision is a context-dependent process and many types of situations are very challenging, such as that of small developing towns. This thesis addresses the problems of urban centres in Pacific Island Countries and the aim is to provide formal explanations of difficulties in these locations to support recommendations that recognize local constraints and opportunities to best practice management. This is achieved largely by employing a perspective based on the science of Complex Adaptive Systems. This perspective has been chosen in recognition that water management incorporates complex interactions between social, technical and natural systems. The research is case study based, focusing primarily on Tarawa in the Pacific Island nation of Kiribati. The methodology includes historical review of the case study, and the use of historical review, as well as interviews and observation in the field as well as a cross-cutting email-based Delphi survey. This has generated qualitative and quantitative data to allow for the formulation of scientific models, an Agent Based Model describing the complex interactions involved in water service delivery; and Bayesian Network models describing the factors impacting on the chances of successful management interventions. With improved explanation of the complex situation, this has been used to support the formulation of a strategic and adaptive governance framework; aiming to introduce much needed organisational memory, and a consistent strategic direction set on the basis of the effective stakeholder interaction. By recognising weakness in capacity, it is possible to turn these into strengths by building and utilising local knowledge and commitment."

            "Water scarcity is an important issue in many countries, and it is therefore necessary to improve the efficiency and equality of water resource allocation for decision makers. Based on game theory (GT), a bi-level optimization model is developed from the perspective of a leader-follower relationship among agents (stakeholders) of a river basin in this study, which consists of a single-agent GT-based optimization model of common interest and a multi-agent cooperative GT-based model. The Hanjiang River Basin is chosen as a case study, where there are conflicts among different interest agents in this basin. The results show that the proposed bi-level model could attain the same improvement of common interest by 8%, with the conventional optimal model. However, different from the conventional optimal model, since the individual interests have been considered in the bi-level optimization model, the willingness of cooperation of individuals has risen from 20% to 80%. With a slight decrease by 3% of only one agent, the increases of interest of other agents are 14%, 18%, 7%, and 14%, respectively, when using the bi-level optimization model. The conclusion could be drawn that the proposed model is superior to the conventional optimal model. Moreover, this study provides scientific support for the large spatial scale water resource allocation model."
